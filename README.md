# PurgoMalumApiTests
### Goals and limitations of the project

The main goal of the project is to get familiar with process of automation testing using Postman. Also I would like to gain knowlegde about communication between systems using Http Api. Http Api, which I've tested is available and described at https://www.purgomalum.com/
Purgomalum involves searching for and removing unwanted words contained in a previously created list of banned words.
Within the project I chose several ednpoints (the most interesting in my opinion) and wrote various types of tests in Postman.

### PurgoMalum HTTP Api tests collection

I divided tests into two folders:
* Purgomalu
* Purgomalum converting to xml + error handling


Inside every folder I created several test cases, which check HTTP response correctness as well as non-functional aspects like response time. Generally tests check whether Disify HTTP Api works as intended (at least according to documentation)

## Disify HTTP Api tests collection
The tests collection, which I created within the project is available at the following link:<br/><br/>
